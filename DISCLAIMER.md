1. This is a personal and individual repository used for the only purpose to watch IPTV channels on Kodi through a M3U list.
2. All links entered on the M3U list come from either official sources or legal (and free) providers.
3. Some channels entered on the M3U list work only through Kodi add-ons and can't be watched otherwise (ex.: 𝘱𝘭𝘶𝘨𝘪𝘯://𝘱𝘭𝘶𝘨𝘪𝘯.𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘰.𝘹𝘹𝘹𝘹/).
4. Most links should work fine on any place in the world, but there might be some channels that are subject to geographical restrictions.
5. There can be a broken link throughout the time between the first edit and the next one. Don't worry, if you stumble upon this repository, the user will take care of the inconvenience and will fix those broken links.
6. If it wasn't already obvious, all the channels displayed on the M3U list are free and public, and there's no pirated or illegal streams on said list.
7. The EPG file I personally use for these channels is the one provided by the user "HelmerLuzo" (you can go to his Github page, he does a great work). A shortened link for the XMLTV file is this: https://www.tdtchannels.com/epg/TV.xml.
8. The channels on the M3U list are already linked to the XMLTV file so there should not be any issues while showing the EPG data.
9. This is the shortened link for the raw M3U list: https://iptvh.it/kodilist.
10. There's no adult/erotic/porn channels in the M3U list. If you want them, you can look them up on any other repository but I won't include them.
11. It is recommended not to create forks for this repository.
